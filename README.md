# intervaltree-go
An interval tree implemented in Go. Currently in progress.

## Goals
1. Polymorphic intervals with an interface that implements comparison and allows a payload (i.e. data attached to an interval)
2. AVL tree implementation instead of a BST.
3. Possibly use concurrent search for some methods.
4. Implement all available functionality in [this](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/intervaltree) Python library.
